# Asteroid Impact Simulator
Interactive web application to simulate asteroid impacts on Earth, powered by real NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) data and physics-based calculations.
## Features
- Select asteroid presets or customize diameter, velocity, impact angle, and density.
- Interactive Leaflet.js globe for precise impact location selection.
- Real-time computation of impact energy (megatons), crater size, seismic magnitude, and damage description.
- Responsive UI with dark/light themes and animated visual feedback.
- Backend Flask API serves presets and performs physics calculations.
- Frontend hosted on Netlify, backend deployed in cloud.
- Collaboration and version control through GitHub.
## Technologies Used
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, Leaflet.js
- Backend: Python Flask REST API
- Data: NASA NEO database, custom asteroid JSON presets
- Deployment: Netlify (frontend), Cloud-hosted Flask API
- Version Control: GitHub
## Installation
1. Clone repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/bharatparmar35036-ship-it/asteroid-sim.git`
2. Setup backend environment, install dependencies, run Flask server.
3. Host frontend using Netlify or any static server.
4. Configure frontend API URLs as needed.
## Usage
